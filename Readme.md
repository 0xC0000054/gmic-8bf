# gmic-8bf

A filter plug-in for Adobe® Photoshop®* and other compatible software that interacts with [G'MIC-Qt](https://github.com/c-koi/gmic-qt).

The latest version can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/0xC0000054/gmic-8bf/releases) tab.

## Installation

1. Close your host application.
2. Place GmicPlugin.8bf and gmic folder in the folder that your host application searches for filter plug-ins.
3. Restart your host application.
4. The plug-in will now be available as the G'MIC-Qt menu item in the GMIC category.

## Usage

To start the plug-in select the G'MIC-Qt item in the filter list of your host application.
The following image shows the menu location in Adobe Photoshop.

When the G'MIC-Qt menu item is clicked it will start the G'MIC-Qt user interface.

You can "layer" multiple G'MIC effects in a single session by clicking the Apply button.
Note that only the most recently applied effect will be used when the plug-in is invoked
through the "Last Filter" or "Repeat Filter" commands.

Filters that require multiple input images can only be used if the document has multiple layers and the host supports
providing layers to the plug-in.
This feature is supported in Adobe Photoshop CS (8.0) and later (and possibly other Adobe applications), but 3rd-party
hosts will most likely not support it due to the license restrictions added to the Photoshop SDK after version 6.0.

If a filter produces multiple output images the plug-in will prompt the user for a folder to copy them into
after the G'MIC-Qt dialog has been closed.
