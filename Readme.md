# gmic-8bf

A filter plug-in for Adobe® Photoshop®* and other compatible software that interacts with [G'MIC-Qt](https://github.com/c-koi/gmic-qt).

The latest version can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/0xC0000054/gmic-8bf/releases) tab.

### System Requirements

* Windows* 7, 8 or 10.
* A compatible 32-bit or 64-bit host application.

## Installation

1. Close your host application.
2. Place GmicPlugin.8bf and gmic folder in the folder that your host application searches for filter plug-ins.
3. Restart your host application.
4. The plug-in will now be available as the G'MIC-Qt menu item in the GMIC category.

### Default plugins folders:
- Photoshop: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Plug-Ins\CC\`

### Updating

Follow the installation instructions above and allow any existing files to be replaced. 

## Usage

To start the plug-in select the G'MIC-Qt item in the filter list of your host application.
The following image shows the menu location in Adobe Photoshop.

### G'MIC-Qt

When the *G'MIC-Qt* menu item is clicked it will start the G'MIC-Qt user interface.

You can "layer" multiple G'MIC effects in a single session by clicking the Apply button.
Note that only the most recently applied effect will be used when the plug-in is invoked
through the "Last Filter" or "Repeat Filter" commands.

Filters that require multiple input images can only be used if the input settings have been configured to provide a
second input image or the document has multiple layers and the host supports providing layers to the plug-in.
Document layers are provided to plug-ins by Adobe Photoshop CS (8.0) and later (and possibly other Adobe applications), but 3rd-party
hosts will most likely not support this feature due to the license restrictions added to the Photoshop SDK after version 6.0.

If the user has not configured a default output folder the plug-in will prompt the user to save the modified images after the
G'MIC-Qt dialog has been closed in the following cases:

1. When a filter produces multiple output images the plug-in will prompt the user for a folder to copy them into.
2. When a filter changes the image size the plug-in will prompt the user to save the resized image.

### Input/Output Settings for G'MIC-Qt

When the *Input/Output Settings for G'MIC-Qt* menu item is clicked it will start the Input/Output Settings for G'MIC-Qt user interface.

#### Input Settings

This section allows a second input image to be sent to G'MIC-Qt for the filters that require one.
The settings in this section will be ignored if the document has multiple layers and the host supports providing layers to plug-ins.

You can choose from one of the following options:

* None (default)
  * The plug-in will only use the document layers for additional input images.
* Clipboard
  * The plug-in will look for a second input image on the operating system clipboard.
* File
  * The plug-in will use the specified image as the second input image.

#### Output Settings

This section allows users to set a default output folder for filters that produce multiple output images or resizes the output image.
The output folder should default to a G'MIC-Qt folder in your Pictures folder, but it can be changed to any folder.   
When this option is configured the plug-in will copy the output image(s) to the specified folder without prompting the user.
A prompt will still be shown if there was an error loading the default folder setting.
